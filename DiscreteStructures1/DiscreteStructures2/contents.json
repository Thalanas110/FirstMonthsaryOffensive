dance,\nTwo figures caught in happenstance.\nYet every bubble, smile, and glance—\nTransforms routine to new romance.\n\nThe hum of buses down the street,\nYour fingers twined with mine in heat.\nEach crowded ride, a throne of kings—\nFor in your hold, I own all things.\n\nWe buy some bread, a simple task,\nYet under this worn cotton mask,\nYour eyes still spark as if they knew—\nI’d walk all worlds just next to you.\n\nYou fold the clothes, I watch, amazed—\nAt how such acts leave me so dazed.\nThe way you move, with grace so true—\nI find the stars revolve round you.\n\nA song plays faint inside the store,\nYou sway a little, I adore.\nI take your hand, we dance in jest—\nYet in that laugh, I am the best.\n\nThe train pulls in, we rush, we stand—\nBut every jolt is soft and grand.\nFor in this motion, close, confined—\nYour nearness echoes in my mind.\n\nYou read a book, I watch instead,\nThe words all blur inside my head.\nFor every blink and every sigh—\nCould write new chapters in the sky.\n\nA simple meal, two bowls of rice,\nBut with you here, it feels like twice.\nThe feast of kings could not compare—\nTo tasting life when you are there.\n\nWe walk through rain without a care,\nOur laughter floating through the air.\nEach droplet feels like sacred wine—\nBecause your hand is locked in mine.\n\nYou hum a tune while cleaning floors,\nA secret song that opens doors.\nAnd though the notes are soft and free—\nThey etch forever into me.\n\nWe take the stairs, a breath, a pause—\nYou glance at me without a cause.\nYet in that glance the world dissolves—\nAnd every problem life absolves.\n\nA lazy couch, a movie on,\nBut with your head against my brawn,\nThe silver screen could never show—\nThe love that through your presence grows.\n\nThe smell of soap within your hair,\nA fleeting scent beyond compare.\nYou tilt your head, I catch my breath—\nIn moments small, you conquer death.\n\nYou yawn and stretch beneath the light,\nI hold you softly through the night.\nAnd in that hush, beneath the moon—\nI vow to never lose this tune.\n\nYou text a heart, a silly face,\nI save it all in sacred space.\nFor even bits of pixel art—\nBecome whole poems in my heart.\n\nYour voice across a crackling line,\nA sound that makes the dull divine.\nI’d trade the grandest symphony—\nTo hear you whisper just to me.\n\nYou set the plate, I fetch the spoon,\nA rhythm plays inside the room.\nThe little steps we take as two—\nCompose a life both rich and new.\n\nYour sleepy gaze at break of day,\nCould light a million miles away.\nAnd though the sun ascends on high—\nIt dims beneath your waking eye.\n\nWe tie our shoes and off we go,\nThrough crowded streets that pulse and flow.\nYet all the world could fade from view—\nIf all I see ahead is you.\n\nYou write your notes, I watch, amazed,\nAt how your hand with purpose sways.\nEach letter curves, each pen-stroke sings—\nThe artistry of simple things.\n\nI warm your tea, you hum a song,\nThe kettle hissing all along.\nSuch tiny acts, yet they inspire—\nA quiet, everlasting fire.\n\nThe market’s loud, the crowd immense,\nYet in your smile I find defense.\nFor chaos melts beneath your gaze—\nAnd calmness blooms through bustling haze.\n\nYour casual way of fixing ties,\nA fleeting brush, yet how it flies.\nFor every touch you grant to me—\nFeels charged with bright eternity.\n\nA folded note beneath my book,\nYour playful hand, your knowing look.\nAnd with that scrap, the world is new—\nBecause it bears the words: “Love you.”\n\nYou clean your glasses with a sigh,\nI’d memorize that look till I—\nAm old and gray, with failing sight,\nStill seeing you in perfect light.\n\nWe walk the dog, a simple loop,\nYet time itself begins to droop.\nFor in your steps beside my own—\nI find a love the stars have known.\n\nYou wipe the mirror with a grin,\nA spark of life through glass and skin.\nAnd I, a witness to your art—\nNow feel reflections in my heart.\n\nYou button cuffs, adjust your sleeve,\nThe smallest moves make me believe—\nThat every day with you in view,\nIs born anew, is ever new.\n\nWe fold the blankets late at night,\nAnd share one kiss beneath the light.\nThough mundane scenes repeat and spin,\nThey feel like magic when you’re in.\n\nYou pass me salt, I pass you tea,\nBut even such simplicity—\nBecomes a ritual held so dear,\nFor every act says: I am here.\n\nYou pack your bag, I watch, I smile,\nAnd think of loving you a while.\nBut then recall this simple truth—\nI’ll love you past the edge of youth.\n\nYou hold the door, I trace your face,\nA sacred, slow, unhurried pace.\nFor though the clock will tick and chime,\nI’ll hold you in each frame of time.\n\nYou fix your hair and I am stunned,\nThat such small grace leaves me undone.\nEach strand, each curl a sacred thread—\nWoven through the life we’ve led.\n\nYou glance at me, a fleeting tease,\nYet in that gaze I find my peace.\nFor though the world spins fast and wide,\nI live where you and I reside.\n\nWe end the day with tangled sheets,\nAnd whispered words in tender beats.\nYet even through this weary night—\nYou are my home, my purest light.\n\nAnd when the dawn returns once more,\nI’ll meet you gladly at the door.\nFor every day, in ways so slight—\nYou turn the mundane into bright.\n\nSo let them say that life is plain,\nI’ll smile and gently not explain.\nFor in your arms, the world I see—\nIs steeped in love’s simplicity.\n\nNo diamond bright, no gilded throne,\nCould match this life we’ve gently grown.\nFor in the small, I’ve come to know—\nWith you, the ordinary glows."

this: with you, I’m truly blessed.\nAnd through those doubts, I’ll hold you tight—\nTill all you see is endless light.\n\nWhen others fade, when friendships part,\nWe’ll still remain, heart next to heart.\nFor in this bond, so rare, so true—\nI’ve found my home, my all, in you.\n\nIf weary eyes should dim with years,\nI’ll kiss away your aging fears.\nAnd when we’re gray, when we are slow—\nOur love will burn in steady glow.\n\nThrough fleeting fame or fleeting pain,\nThrough sunny skies or pouring rain.\nNo force on earth, no twist of fate—\nCan ever make me hesitate.\n\nWhen dreams seem lost, when plans fall through,\nWe’ll find new dreams—just me and you.\nFor what we have is strong and pure—\nThrough any storm, we will endure.\n\nIf memory fades, if names grow faint,\nMy heart will still with love be quaint.\nFor deeper than what mind can hold—\nIs love that’s rooted, vast and bold.\n\nWhen death one day will claim its due,\nMy final breath will speak of you.\nFor through this life and past its door—\nMy love will reach forevermore.\n\nBut till that time, through each today,\nI’ll love you strong in every way.\nAnd side by side, through thick and thin—\nTogether still, we’ll always win.\n\nSo let the world throw what it may,\nIn you, my love will ever stay.\nNo greater vow, no grander creed—\nThan loving you in word and deed.\n\nFor through all storms, through dark and light,\nWith you, my soul will take its flight.\nTogether, strong—through loss and glee—\nForever one, just you and me."

        "content": "The music starts, my heart takes flight,\nThe doors swing wide, floods in the light.\nA vision there—so pure, so true—\nYou walk the aisle, my love, to you.\n\nYour gown aglow, a gentle gleam,\nMore radiant than any dream.\nEach step you take, a silent vow—\nI see forever in you now.\n\nThe crowd dissolves, the room fades gray,\nFor only you fill all my day.\nMy trembling hands, my tearful eyes—\nBehold my love, my sweetest prize.\n\nA nervous smile beneath your veil,\nYet in your gaze, no doubt, no pale.\nYour courage wrapped in satin white—\nMy beacon bright through every night.\n\nPetals beneath your feet are strewn,\nYet none compare to your soft tune.\nFor in your heart, I clearly see—\nYou walk this path to be with me.\n\nMy breath is caught, my pulse runs wild,\nFor there you are—my dream, my child.\nThe one I prayed would stand so near—\nAnd now you come, my love, sincere.\n\nEach graceful step, a beat of time,\nA whispered echo in the chime.\nThe aisle, though long, is but a thread—\nThat binds our lives where love is led.\n\nYour father's arm now holds you close,\nA moment shared, a gentle dose.\nYet in your eyes, one truth remains—\nYou're coming home to where love reigns.\n\nThe flowers bloom, the people smile,\nBut none can feel what stirs this mile.\nFor in this path, beneath these beams—\nYou walk into our woven dreams.\n\nThe veil may hide your glowing face,\nBut cannot dim your tender grace.\nEach step a promise, pure and new—\nTo build a life with me and you.\n\nMy heart pounds loud, a steady drum,\nFor here you are—my one, my sun.\nNo richer gift, no grander sight—\nThan seeing you in perfect light.\n\nThe world may cheer, the cameras flash,\nBut none can steal this moment’s stash.\nFor here you walk—a sacred vow—\nMy love, my future, with me now.\n\nYou draw in close, the distance small,\nAnd I behold the greatest call.\nNo need for words, your gaze has said—\nI am your love, by heart I’m led.\n\nAnd as you near, the silence breaks,\nMy trembling hand, the promise takes.\nFor in your eyes I see it clear—\nForever starts when you are near.\n\nYour dress may shimmer, veil may flow,\nBut it’s your soul I’ve come to know.\nAnd with each step along this floor—\nI love you deeper, more and more.\n\nThe aisle may stretch, but not enough,\nTo match the depth of all our love.\nEach moment brings you closer still—\nTo share this life, to share this will.\n\nYou smile now wide, the tears do fall,\nFor here we stand, we have it all.\nThis path you take, so soft, so sweet—\nWill end with us, in love complete.\n\nMy eyes won’t leave your gentle face,\nAs time dissolves in your embrace.\nFor every second now you’re near—\nIs filled with joy and hope sincere.\n\nYou pause a breath, you near the end,\nYour trembling fingers soon will blend.\nWith mine, forever, sealed as one—\nA story bright, a love begun.\n\nI see you now, just feet away,\nWith every tear, my heart will say—\nI’ll love you through the storm and sun,\nUntil all time and breath are done.\n\nYour father smiles, a nod, a tear,\nHe knows your place is waiting here.\nAnd now he gives your hand to mine—\nTo hold through life, through love, through time.\n\nYour fingers soft in trembling grace,\nYou lift your eyes to meet my face.\nAnd in that gaze, I know it true—\nNo force will part my soul from you.\n\nThe world in hush, the vows await,\nYet in this moment, seals our fate.\nFor every step you took to me—\nWas love’s most perfect symphony.\n\nNo fear remains, no shadows lurk,\nNo stronger bond can life’s hand work.\nFor here before both earth and sky—\nI vow to love you till I die.\n\nAnd though you walked that aisle alone,\nFrom this day forth, you’ll never roam.\nFor hand in hand, through every strife—\nWe’ll build a vast and boundless life.\n\nI kiss your brow, your trembling cheek,\nNo words can hold the love I speak.\nFor in your eyes, and in your smile—\nI’ve waited long for this sweet aisle.\n\nThe rings await, the vows are near,\nYet all I need is you, my dear.\nFor in your steps, both firm and true—\nYou’ve given all your life to do.\n\nSo take this vow beneath this sun,\nAnd let us forge two hearts as one.\nFor every step that led you here—\nHas brought us joy beyond all fear.\n\nAnd as the words begin to flow,\nOur faces bright, our hearts aglow.\nForever starts with this sweet day—\nWhen you walked forth in white array.\n\nThe aisle, the dress, the music’s sound—\nAll fades to where our love is found.\nFor here we stand, through time and tide—\nForever groom and blushing bride.\n\nSo hear me now beneath this sky,\nI’ll love you till the stars run dry.\nFor when you walked that aisle to me—\nYou gave me life’s eternity.\n\nAnd when we kiss, the room will cheer,\nYet all I’ll know is you are here.\nForevermore, through thick and thin—\nOur life, our love, shall now begin.\n\nSo walk to me with head held high,\nNo fear of past, no need to cry.\nFor in this heart, forever stays—\nThe girl I watched that aisle blaze.\n\nAnd when the music soft will end,\nWe’ll turn, as one, with hands to lend.\nTo face the world, both side by side—\nForever groom and blushing bride.\n\nFor in that walk, in every pace,\nYou filled my world with boundless grace.\nAnd now we stand, beneath love’s dome—\nTwo hearts, one soul, forever home."
