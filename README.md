# 💖 First Monthsary Offensive 💖

Welcome, my love.

This isn't just code.  
This is a letter. A memory. A moment. A celebration of **us**.

## 📅 What is this?

A web-based surprise, handcrafted by your nerdy fiancé(e) to celebrate our **first monthsary**.  
Simple, but full of love. A little digital garden where our story quietly blooms.

## 💡 Why "Offensive"?

Because I couldn't sit back and do nothing.  
This is me taking the offensive—fighting against time, distance, and everything else—to make you smile, even just for a moment.  
Love isn't passive. It's bold. It's deliberate.

## 🖼️ What's inside?

- **`index.html`** — The heart of it all.
- **`painting.css`** — Styled with affection.
- **A silhouette of love** — A quiet sunset, just like the peace I feel with you.
- **A promise** — That each monthsary will be different. Special. Ours.

## 🛠️ How to view

Just open `index.html` in your browser. Preferably with soft music in the background, and a warm drink nearby.
